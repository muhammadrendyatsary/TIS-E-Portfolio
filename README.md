## 📝 Reflections

### 1. Industry Talk / Visit
**What I gained:**  
During the industrial visit, I realized that future developers are expected to evolve into system architects rather than only focusing on writing code. The speaker highlighted the importance of understanding how different technologies and components work together in a system.

**Improvement:**  
The session could be improved by allowing more time for interaction and questions with the speaker.

---

### 2. PC Assemble
**What I gained:**  
I learned to identify the main components of a computer and how to safely assemble hardware such as the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and power supply.

**Improvement:**  
More hands-on time, especially for cable management, would improve learning.

---

### 3. Design Thinking
**What I gained:**  
I learned how to apply the design thinking process to solve problems and collaborate with my group to create a low-fidelity prototype and poster.

**Improvement:**  
Better task distribution within the group would improve efficiency.

---

### 4. Tic-Tac-Toe Project
**What I gained:**  
I improved my understanding of C++ logic and teamwork skills through explaining the game flow during the presentation.

**Improvement:**  
The project could be improved by implementing a graphical user interface.

---

### 5. Network Infrastructure
**What I gained:**  
I learned the differences between LAN and WAN connections and how network infrastructure supports device communication.

**Improvement:**  
More real-world examples would help strengthen understanding.

---

### 6. Database Project
**What I gained:**  
I learned basic database design concepts such as ERD, table relationships, and normalization.

**Improvement:**  
Using real datasets would make the learning experience more practical.
