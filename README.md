## 💭 Reflections

### 1. Industry Talk / Visit
**What I gained:** This visit gave me valuable insight into the current trends in the IT industry and how the concepts we learn in class are applied in real-world professional environments. It helped bridge the gap between academic theory and industry practice.
**Improvement:** It would be beneficial to have a longer Q&A session with the industry practitioners to ask more specific questions about career paths.

### 2. PC Assemble (Lab)
**What I gained:** I gained hands-on experience in identifying and assembling computer components like the CPU, motherboard, and RAM. This lab taught me the importance of safety precautions and proper cable management when building a system.
**Improvement:** I suggest adding a troubleshooting segment where we have to diagnose and fix a PC that intentionally doesn't boot.

### 3. Design Thinking
**What I gained:** I learned the full process of user-centric design, from empathizing with users to prototyping a solution. Creating the low-fidelity poster helped me visualize how to solve problems creatively before writing any code.
**Improvement:** For future projects, creating a high-fidelity digital prototype using tools like Figma would provide a more realistic user experience.

### 4. Tic-Tac-Toe Project
**What I gained:** This project strengthened my C++ programming skills, particularly in using arrays and logic loops. Working in a group taught me how to collaborate on code, manage versions, and debug errors effectively as a team.
**Improvement:** We could improve the game by adding a Graphical User Interface (GUI) instead of running it only in the console window.

### 5. Network Infrastructure
**What I gained:** I learned the fundamental differences between LAN and WAN and how to design a network topology that meets specific requirements. This assignment clarified how data is transmitted across different devices.
**Improvement:** Simulating the network using software like Cisco Packet Tracer would help verify the connection speeds and errors more accurately.

### 6. Database Project
**What I gained:** I understood how to structure data efficiently using Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD). This phase showed me the importance of good database design in preventing data redundancy and ensuring data integrity.
**Improvement:** Learning basic SQL queries alongside the design phase would help in understanding how the tables will eventually be accessed.
